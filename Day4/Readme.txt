•Overriding
•Dyanamic Dispatch Method/Upcasting
•Can we override static method or not???? (No becuase of method hiding)
•Super-It is used to access imidiate parent class method and data memeber.
•Constructor in inheritance
    ?Child class constructor always executes its parent class constructor first if due to any reason parent     class constructor not exist then its compile time error (only valid for default and unparamaterized         constructor)
•A class cannot be private or protected
•A class cannot be static but only inner class can be static
•Abstract class
?Abstract class can have abstract as well as non abstract method
?Abstact keyword are used to make a class as an abstract class and a method as an abstract method
?Abstract class object cannot be created
•Interface
?Interface is the collection of public static and final variable and abstract method
?All the variables are by default public static and final
2 Rules:
?An interface can extend another interface
?A class can implement multiple interface
